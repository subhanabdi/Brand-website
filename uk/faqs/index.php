                              Once deposit is received, normal turnaround for print design is 48 hours. The design files are your artwork and we are up front about this part of the process.

                              Social media platforms are things like Facebook and Twitter. Each of these platforms include a profile photo and a cover/header image or banners. We design these images to suit your logo and fit exactly within the platforms size specifications.

                              You do! Some graphic designers try to hold files hostage in order to keep your business, but with Iconic, you get it all. That includes the copyright. We don’t attempt to retain any rights on the work, although we do like to use what we have created for you to give our portfolio a boost. We believe in making EVERY project a portfolio piece.
